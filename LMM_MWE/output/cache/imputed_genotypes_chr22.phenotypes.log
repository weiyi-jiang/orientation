-108475  107805

Source	Variance	SE
Vg	9.43996	330.389
Ve	9.25101	328.337
Vp	18.691

Heritability = 0.505054 (Pval = 0.977206)
fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.0881294 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant. This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.
